# CIS 163 Lab 06 - Recursion

## Objectives

* To be comfortable with writing recursive programs
* To be able to use recursion on an exam

### Notes

* This will be your primary opportunity to practice
  recursion
* You will need to implement/understand recursion
  for the exams so make sure you are comfortable with
  it.
* This may take you additional time outside of lab.  You will need
  to show the instructor that you completed these
  at the start of next week's lab if you do not complete
  them before leaving today.

### Tasks

* Go to codingbat.com/java
* If you already have an account, login.  If not
  create an account (upper right).
* Select "Recursion 1" and complete the following
  problems using recursion. You MUST use recursion.
    * strCount
    * nestParen
    * endX
    * bunnyEars2
    * strCopies
* Choose 2 other problems of your choice to complete (other than
  fibonaci or factorial as we completed those in class).
* Click "CodingBat" in upper left and select "Recursion2".  Solve
  the following problems using recursion.
    * groupSum
* Go to https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-power-sum/problem
  and complete the problem.  This one will be harder than the others.

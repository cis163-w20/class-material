Big Picture:

With all of the below, you should be able to look at code
and identify what is happening to actually apply these
concepts.  For example (not all inclusive):

* You should be able to go through a provided piece of
  code and identify the output (the code may involve
  references, inheritance, interfaces, exceptions).
* You should be able to draw call graphs of what functions
  are called in a code snippet and follow these back
  (aka identify how many times a function has been called,
  have they all returned, where was this call of this function
  called from)
* You should be able to identify at any point in a code
  snippet the value of all variables in that scope (including
  drawing out what is happening behind the scenes such as
  whether two references actually point to the same memory)

Overview of 
* Java references
    * what are references
    * what impact does this have
    * when will things change
* Arrays/ArrayLists
    * be comfortable using
    * understand code with either
    * understand 2D arrays and how to access
    * when we would use one over the other, when to use 2D arrays
* Inheritance
    * When to use inheritance
    * How inheritance is denoted in Java
    * What happens when one class inherits from another
    * Overriding vs Overloading
    * abstract classes, abstract methods
    * purpose of abstract
    * single vs multiple inheritance (what does Java have and why?)
    * when can you instantiate a class?
    * when do you use the `final` keyword?
* Interfaces
    * how they differ from inheritance and abstract classes
    * how you implement one
    * when you should use
    * how interfaces and inheritance can be combined
    * can you instantiate an interface?
    * can a class implement multiple interfaces?
* Exceptions
    * what are they
    * understand the basics of some common ones
      (Arithmetic, IllegalArgument, NullPointer, etc.)
    * what code will cause an exception
    * how do try/catch blocks work? which catch will be entered? what is finally?
    * checked vs unchecked
    * what must you do with checked (what are your 2 options)?
    * what happens if an unchecked exception is not handled where it occurs?
      you should be able to follow through code what is happening if
      it is handled in a different spot (or not handled at all?)
* UML
    * you should understand the different relationships represented in UML
    * given code, you should be able to draw the UML diagram
    * given a diagram, you should be able to sketch out the code excluding
      implementation of any methods
* GUI
    * in general, how do they work?
        * overall setup
        * purpose of frame, panel, etc.
        * general format of how you react to events
* Lambdas
    * What they are?
    * Why to use?
    * How they are different from anonymous classes
    * Be able to write a small one
* Miscellaneous
    * `static` methods and variables - what are they, how do you access

# Searching

If we have a group of objects (like an ArrayList or
array), one common task is to find a designated target
or determine that it doesn't exist.

This process is called "searching". 

## Task 1
Write a function that takes in an array and returns
either the index of the element, or -1 if the element
is not in the array
```
public static int search(int[] data, int val){














}
```

## Task 2

If the input array was sorted, is there a way
we could implement this that would do fewer comparisons?

Try writing the function.
